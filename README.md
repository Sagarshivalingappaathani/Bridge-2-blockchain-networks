# Cross-Chain Bridge Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a cross-chain bridge facilitating the transfer of tokens between two different blockchains.  The bridge utilizes two distinct bridges (Bridge1 and Bridge2) and two different tokens (Token1 and Token2) for interoperability.

## Features

* **Cross-Chain Transfer:** Enables the secure transfer of Token1 and Token2 between the two supported blockchains.
* **Two Bridge Contracts:** Employs separate bridge contracts (Bridge1 and Bridge2) for enhanced security and modularity.
* **Two ERC-20 Tokens:**  Utilizes two custom ERC-20 tokens (Token1 and Token2) for the transfer process.
